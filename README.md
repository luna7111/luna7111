# Hello! 🌕

My name is Luna del Valle, I'm a student at 42 Madrid since September 2024 and I love software development and open-source stuff among other things.

- Currently I'm learning C and 3D modeling in Blender
- I'm interested in accesibility, my main goal is making tools and resources accesible and inclusive for everyone.
- I preffer they/them pronouns although I usually go by she/her in my daily life.

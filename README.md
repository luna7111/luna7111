# Hello! 🌔

My name is Luna del Valle, I'm a student at 42 Madrid since September 2024 and I love software development and open-source stuff among other things.

- 💻 Currently I'm learning Rust and Lua.
- 🫶🏻 I'm interested in teaching and pedagogy, my main goal is making tools and resources accessible and inclusive for everyone.
- ✨ I prefer they/them pronouns although I usually go by she/her in my daily life.
- 🧮 Ask me about digital logic circuits!
